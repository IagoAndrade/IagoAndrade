- 👋 Hi, I’m @IagoAndrade
- 👀 I’m interested in game development and its related tools, free and open source software, mechanical engineering, 3D modeling software, art in general and all tools related to it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software development in C and Python, and developing my SQL scripting skills for more complex database analysis.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on free and open source projects, for both developing my skills in programming and helping useful tools become even better.
